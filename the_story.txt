Once upon a time


Tottenham Hotspur is top of the Premiere League
The Premiere League is the toughest league in England
I walked into Lafferre
And fell down the stairs
There was a CS student named Noah,
And he forgot to set up vim properly on his new computer so it looks and acts all wrong but it's fine he's doing fine.

The end.
