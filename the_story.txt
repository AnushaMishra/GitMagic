Once upon a time


It was cold. 
So cold, that the people feared they would not be able to make it through the winter.
Upon the ramparts of Fort Lafferre, a guild of adventurers lived.

They where bold and returning. 
They ate and drank merrily, indulging in the rewards earned by their bravery.
They enjoyed their night thoroughly, know they would be given their next quest in the morning.
And in the morning the great wizard woke.
With a great belowing voice a new quest he had spoke.

The end.
